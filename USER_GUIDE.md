## 1. Hardware Overview

The device utilises the standard buttons on the Xtink X4 (in the same layout as the manufacturer firmware, by default):

### Button Layout
| Location        | Buttons                                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bottom Edge** | **Back**, **Confirm**, **Left**, **Right**           |
| **Right Side**  | **Power**, **Volume Up**, **Volume Down**, **Reset** |

Button layout can be customized in **[Settings](#35-settings)**.

---

## 2. Power & Startup

### Power On / Off

To turn the device on or off, **press and hold the Power button for approximately half a second**.
In **[Settings](#35-settings)** you can configure the power button to turn the device off with a short press instead of a long one.

To reboot the device (for example if it's frozen, or after a firmware update), press and release the Reset button, and then quickly press and hold the Power button for a few seconds.

### First Launch

Upon turning the device on for the first time, you will be placed on the **[Home](#31-home-screen)** screen.

> [!NOTE]
> On subsequent restarts, the firmware will automatically reopen the last book you were reading.

---

## 3. Screens

### 3.1 Home Screen

The Home Screen is the main entry point to the firmware. From here you can navigate to **[Reading Mode](#4-reading-mode)** with the most recently read book, **[Book Selection](#32-book-selection)**, **[Settings](#35-settings)**, or the **[File Upload](#34-file-upload-screen)** screen.

### 3.2 Book Selection

The Book Selection acts as a folder and file browser.

* **Navigate List:** Use **Left** (or **Volume Up**), or **Right** (or **Volume Down**) to move the selection cursor up and down through folders and books. You can also long-press these buttons to scroll a full page up or down.
* **Open Selection:** Press **Confirm** to open a folder or read a selected book.

### 3.3 Reading Mode

See [Reading Mode](#4-reading-mode) below for more information.

### 3.4 File Upload Screen

The File Upload screen allows you to upload new e-books to the device. When you enter the screen, you'll be prompted with a WiFi selection dialog and then your X4 will start hosting a web server.

See the [webserver docs](./docs/webserver.md) for more information on how to connect to the web server and upload files.

> [!TIP]
> Advanced users can also manage files programmatically or via the command line using `curl`. See the [webserver docs](./docs/webserver.md) for details.

### 3.4.1 Calibre Wireless Transfers

- **Check for updates**: Check for firmware updates over WiFi.

### 3.6 Sleep Screen

You can customize the sleep screen by placing custom images in specific locations on the SD card:

- **Single Image:** Place a file named `sleep.bmp` in the root directory.
- **Multiple Images:** Create a `sleep` directory in the root of the SD card and place any number of `.bmp` images inside. If images are found in this directory, they will take priority over the `sleep.bmp` file, and one will be randomly selected each time the device sleeps.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to set the **Sleep Screen** setting to **Custom** in order to use these images.

> [!TIP]
> For best results:
> - Use uncompressed BMP files with 24-bit color depth
> - Use a resolution of 480x800 pixels to match the device's screen resolution.
